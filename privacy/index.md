### Notifications
Notifications are processed and created entirely on-device. We do not use notifications for marketing.

### iCloud
Appealing Apps stores your data, including your user-generated app content and settings, into Apple's iCloud service in order to enable syncing between all devices signed into your Apple ID.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Accessing, Changing, or Deleting Information
Your account data is managed in Apple's iCloud service and cannot be accessed by Appealing Apps. Deleting your information is accomplished through Apple's settings interface.

Appealing Apps may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
